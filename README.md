"annual_ghg_emissions_reductions_mt_co2e" refers to the amount of annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that have been reduced or avoided, measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MT CO2e). This metric is commonly used to track progress in reducing GHG emissions, which contribute to climate change. The term "CO2e" refers to the amount of CO2 that would have the same warming effect as the combination of all other GHGs, such as methane and nitrous oxide.

We see that the count of annual_ghg_emissions_reductions_mt_co2e with the value between 2 and 3 is more in the datset which means that the count of total amount of greenhouse gases emissions (measured in metric tons of CO2 equivalent) that have been reduced in a given year is between 2 and 3 is large which is good for the environment.

This reduction can be due to various measures taken to mitigate emissions such as the adoption of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency improvements, or carbon capture and storage technologies.

Since our dataset is concerned with electric vehicles, this means that if the businesses develop electric cars in India it would be beneficial to the environment sin
