# Electric Vehicles emission reduction Dataset Conclusion Feynn Labs Project 2

## Conclusion 1:
"annual_ghg_emissions_reductions_mt_co2e" refers to the amount of annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that have been reduced or avoided, measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MT CO2e). This metric is commonly used to track progress in reducing GHG emissions, which contribute to climate change. The term "CO2e" refers to the amount of CO2 that would have the same warming effect as the combination of all other GHGs, such as methane and nitrous oxide.

We see that the count of annual_ghg_emissions_reductions_mt_co2e with the value between 2 and 3 is more in the datset which means that the count of total amount of greenhouse gases emissions (measured in metric tons of CO2 equivalent) that have been reduced in a given year is between 2 and 3 is large which is good for the environment.

This reduction can be due to various measures taken to mitigate emissions such as the adoption of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency improvements, or carbon capture and storage technologies.

Since our dataset is concerned with electric vehicles, this means that if the businesses develop electric cars in India it would be beneficial to the environment sin

## Conclusion 2:
Annual petroleum reductions gallons is a measure of the amount of petroleum (usually gasoline or diesel) that is saved or not used due to a particular action or change in behavior. It is usually expressed in gallons per year and is used to quantify the impact of different policies, programs, or technologies that aim to reduce petroleum consumption and dependence.

We see that the count of annual_petroleum_reductions_gallons with the value between 400 and 500 and around 600 is more in the datset which means that the count of total amount of petroleum (usually gasoline or diesel) that is saved is more which is good for the environment.

Since our dataset is concerned with electric vehicles, this means that if the businesses develop electric cars in India it would be beneficial to the environment since the total amount of petroleum usage(usually gasoline or diesel) is saved.

## Conclusion 3:
we plotted a scatter plot representing collection of points, where each point represents a specific intervention or action taken to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and petroleum usage. The x-axis represents the amount of GHG emissions reduced (in metric tons of CO2 equivalent) as a result of the intervention, while the y-axis represents the amount of petroleum usage reduced (in gallons) due to the intervention.

The scatter plot helps visualize any correlation or relationship between the reduction in GHG emissions and petroleum usage.

The points are tightly clustered around a diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right, it indicates a strong positive correlation, suggesting that as GHG emissions are reduced, so too is petroleum usage.

Since our dataset is concerned with electric vehicles, this means that if the businesses develop electric cars in India it would be beneficial to the environment since the GHG emissions are reduced, so too is petroleum usage. More the amount of GHG emissions reduced , more the reduction in petroleum usage , which is beneficial for the businesses to develop electric cars in India
